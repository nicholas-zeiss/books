				Greetings! I am Gloria Koster, a children's author and librarian. For many year's I worked full-time at a wonderful elementary school.
				Now I am lucky enough to be the part-time director of the <a href='http://www.poundridgelibrary.org/'>Pound Ridge Library</a> in my hometown of Pound Ridge, New York. Working part-time
				provides more opportunity for writing, and that's fantastic! I am working on a humorous picture book and finishing up two picture book
				biographies. Stay tuned.
			</p>
			<p>
				My husband Eric and I have three adult children and a batch of little grandsons. When we're not at home, we're generally heading north to
				Vermont or into nearby New York City. We also love to travel, especially to France, where I continue to embarrass myself by stumbling
				over the elegant language. Quel dommage!
			</p>

	 			My newest book, <strong><i>Little Red Ruthie</i></strong>, was published in August of 2017. Like my previous book, <strong><i>Mitzi's Mitzvah</i></strong>, it is a <a href='https://pjlibrary.org/home'>
	 			PJ Library selection.</a> My first book, <strong><i>The Peanut-Free Caf&eacute;</i></strong>, was inspired by all the time I spent in a school lunchroom, watching a lot of fussy eaters
	 			and the challenges faced by kids with food allergies.
