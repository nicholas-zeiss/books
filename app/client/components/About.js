				Greetings! I am Gloria Koster, a children's author and librarian. For many years I worked full-time at a wonderful Connecticut elementary school. I’ve also served as an interim director of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.poundridgelibrary.org/">Pound Ridge Library</a> in my hometown of Pound Ridge, New York.
			</p>
			<p>
				Currently I am a member of the Children's Book Committee of the Bank Street College of Education. Each year we read hundreds of new titles to select the very finest choices to be included in our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bankstreet.edu/library/center-for-childrens-literature/childrens-book-committee/best-childrens-books-of-the-year/">Best Books guide.</a>

				I’m also a member of the Women’s National Book Association, serving as Co-Chair of the WNBA Pannell Award. Each year we honor two Independent Book Stores for their services to children.
